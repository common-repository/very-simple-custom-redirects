== Description ==
= About =
With this lightweight plugin you can set a custom page redirect for the default Login, Logout, Register and Lost Password feature.

All default user roles are supported (administrator, editor, author, contributor and subscriber).

Do not use this plugin simultaneously with redirect features in other plugins. This may cause a conflict.

= How to use =
After installation go to the settings page and set up your redirects. This page is located at Settings > Redirects.

= Have a question? =
Please take a look at the FAQ section.

= Translation =
Translations are not included, but the plugin supports WordPress language packs.

More [translations](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/very-simple-custom-redirects) are very welcome!

The translation folder inside this plugin is redundant, but kept for reference.

= Credits =
Without help and support from the WordPress community I was not able to develop this plugin, so thank you!


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I set plugin language? =
The plugin will use the website language, set in Settings > General.

If translations are not available in the selected language, English will be used.

= Where to find the page ID? =
Every page URL contains an unique ID. You will find this ID when hovering the page title in your dashboard or when editing the page.

It's the number that comes after: `post=`

= Does plugin support custom user roles? =
No, plugin only supports the default user roles (administrator, editor, author, contributor and subscriber).

= Why is there no semantic versioning? =
The version number won't give you info about the type of update (major, minor, patch). You should check the changelog to see whether or not the update is a major or minor one.

= How can I make a donation? =
You like my plugin and want to make a donation? There's a PayPal donate link at my website. Thank you!

= Other questions or comments? =
